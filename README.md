Workflow
After your branch is done:

1. Make a Merge Request to the development branch.
2. Someone will check out that Merge Request, fix it up until it's good,then accept it.
3. Run tests on development to make sure that merge didn't break anything.
4. If development is 100% working, make a Merge Request to master.

Master will always be the most up-to-date 100% WORKING code.
